# FUNDING USE CASES (PERMITTED / PROHIBITED)

**Purpose:** Provide lender-facing clarity on use of proceeds and protect the program from reputational risk.

---

## I. PERMITTED USES OF PROCEEDS

Subject to loan agreement covenants and applicable law:

- Working capital
- Business expansion
- Inventory purchases (non-prohibited)
- Operating expenses
- Refinancing existing debt (with lender consent)
- Transaction costs (custody, insurance, legal fees)

---

## II. PROHIBITED USES (RECOMMENDED)

- Speculative trading in crypto or leveraged instruments
- Payments to sanctioned parties
- Illegal activities
- Dividends/distributions to equity holders while facility outstanding (unless explicitly allowed)
- Related-party transfers without disclosure and lender consent

---

## III. WHY THIS MATTERS

Lenders care because:
- proceeds misuse increases default probability
- proceeds misuse triggers regulatory/AML concerns
- proceeds misuse creates reputational risk

Clear permitted/prohibited categories reduces diligence friction.
