# LTV MODEL (ALEXANDRITE COLLATERAL)

**Appraised Value:** USD $42,000,000 (Aug 18, 2025 appraisal)  
**Instrument:** `ALXUSD` (XRPL IOU) and/or secured credit facility

---

## I. BASE PRINCIPLE

Gemstone collateral is illiquid and valuation is negotiated. LTV must reflect:
- liquidation time
- price discovery uncertainty
- cutting yield uncertainty
- buyer concentration

Institutional practice is to apply a conservative haircut.

### C) Aggressive (Specialist)

## III. NUMERIC TABLE

| Appraisal | Haircut | Implied Liquidation Value | LTV | Facility Size |
|----------:|--------:|---------------------------:|----:|--------------:|
| 42,000,000 | 80% | 8,400,000 | 24% vs appraisal | 8,400,000 |
| 42,000,000 | 75% | 10,500,000 | 25% | 10,500,000 |
| 42,000,000 | 70% | 12,600,000 | 30% | 12,600,000 |
| 42,000,000 | 65% | 14,700,000 | 35% | 14,700,000 |
| 42,000,000 | 60% | 16,800,000 | 40% | 16,800,000 |

**Recommendation (initial):** $5M–$10M issuance/facility to establish track record.

---

## IV. WHY $10M CAP IS CREDIBLE

- $10M against $42M appraisal implies 76% haircut (24% LTV).
- This is conservative by any alternative-asset lending standard.
- It reduces reputational and regulatory risk by avoiding “over-issuance.”

---

## V. COVENANT TRIGGERS (VALUE DECLINE)

Recommended triggers:

- **Soft trigger:** appraisal reaffirmation falls below $35M  
  Action: enhanced reporting, lender discussion.

- **Hard trigger:** appraisal falls below $30M  
  Action: mandatory paydown or cap reduction.

- **Insurance breach:** coverage below required level  
  Action: immediate cure period, then default.

---

## VI. LINK TO IOU PROGRAM

`ALXUSD` cap should not exceed the credit facility capacity unless explicitly structured.

For clean institutional story:
- Use **one** cap ($10M) across IOU issuance and debt facility.
- Require board approval to increase cap.
