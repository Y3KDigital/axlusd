## II. DETAILED TERMS

#### **Conservative Structure (LTV = 24%)**
**Facility Size:** USD $10,000,000  
**Valuation Basis:** $42,000,000 appraisal  
**LTV Calculation:** $10M / $42M = 23.8%

**Rationale:**
- Highly conservative haircut (60% discount)
- Accounts for illiquidity, valuation uncertainty, and cutting yield risk
- Provides lender with strong cushion
- Typical for first-time gemstone-backed financing

**Ideal Lender Profile:**
- Risk-averse private credit funds
- Banks with alternative asset desks
- First-time gemstone lenders

---

#### **Moderate Structure (LTV = 30%)**
**Facility Size:** USD $12,500,000  
**LTV Calculation:** $12.5M / $42M = 29.8%

**Rationale:**
- Balanced risk/reward
- Still provides 70% cushion to lender
- Reflects confidence in appraisal and custodian

**Ideal Lender Profile:**
- Experienced commodity lenders
- Family offices with alternative asset experience
- Private credit funds with RWA focus

---

#### **Aggressive Structure (LTV = 36%)**
**Facility Size:** USD $15,000,000

**Rationale:**
- Assumes lender confidence in appraisal and liquidation potential
- Competitive with other alternative asset-backed facilities (art, wine, etc.)
- Requires strong lender relationship or track record

**Ideal Lender Profile:**
- Gemstone specialists
- High-net-worth individuals with industry knowledge
- Private credit funds with aggressive mandates

---

### B. INTEREST RATE STRUCTURES

#### **Option 1: Fixed Rate**
**Rate:** 10.0% per annum  
**Payment Frequency:** Quarterly (in arrears)  
**Calculation:** Simple interest on outstanding principal

**Example (on $12.5M facility):**

**Advantages:**
- Predictability for borrower
- Simple to administer

---

#### **Option 2: Floating Rate**
**Rate:** SOFR + 600 basis points (6.0%)  
**Payment Frequency:** Quarterly  
**Floor:** SOFR floor of 3.0% (rate never below 9.0%)  
**Cap:** Optional (e.g., 12.0% cap)

**Example (if SOFR = 4.5%):**
- Rate = 4.5% + 6.0% = 10.5%
- Annual interest on $12.5M = $1,312,500

**Advantages:**
- Market-responsive
- Typical for institutional credit facilities

---

#### **Option 3: Payment-in-Kind (PIK) Structure**
**Rate:** 12.0% per annum, accruing (not paid in cash)  
**Payment:** All interest and principal due at maturity or asset sale

**Example:**
- Borrow $12.5M at 12% PIK
- After 3 years: $12.5M × (1.12)³ = $17.5M due

**Advantages:**
- No cash flow burden on borrower
- Attractive if asset appreciation expected

**Disadvantages:**
- Higher effective cost
- Lender takes more risk (no interim cash flow)

---

### C. SECURITY & COLLATERAL

#### **Perfected Security Interest**

**Method:** First-priority lien on Asset, perfected via:

1. **UCC-1 Financing Statement** (if US-based SPV)
   - Filed in SPV's state of organization
   - Describes collateral as "rough gemstone asset, Seal ID 00289944"
   - Lender listed as secured party

2. **Custodian Control Agreement** (critical)
   - Custodian (e.g., Malca-Amit) agrees to follow lender's instructions
   - Asset cannot be released without lender consent
   - Creates perfected security interest similar to "pledge" or "control"

3. **Assignment of Insurance** (additional security)
   - SPV assigns all-risk insurance proceeds to lender
   - Lender named as loss payee

**Result:**
- Lender has first claim on Asset
- Borrower (SPV) retains legal ownership but cannot access Asset without lender approval

---

#### **Custodian Release Procedures**

**Normal Operations:**
- Quarterly inspections: Allowed with lender notice (no consent required)
- Appraisal updates: Allowed with lender notice

**Restricted Actions (Require Lender Consent):**

## VI. COMPARISON: GEMSTONE VS. OTHER ALTERNATIVE COLLATERAL

| **Collateral Type** | **Typical LTV** | **Typical Interest Rate** | **Lender Appetite** |
|---------------------|----------------|--------------------------|---------------------|
| **Gold / Silver** | 50-70% | 5-8% | High (liquid commodity) |
| **Fine Art** | 30-50% | 6-10% | Medium (established market) |
| **Wine (rare)** | 40-60% | 7-11% | Medium (niche but growing) |
| **Rough Gemstones** | 20-40% | 8-12% | Low to Medium (niche, illiquid) |
| **Real Estate** | 60-80% | 5-7% | High (very liquid) |

**Takeaway:** Our proposed 24-36% LTV is market-appropriate given gemstone illiquidity.

- **Quarterly:** Interest payments, custodian confirmations, seal verifications
- **Annually:** Updated appraisal, insurance renewal, financial statements
- **Ad Hoc:** Lender inspections (upon reasonable notice)

---

### **Exit Scenarios**

**1. Refinancing (Most Likely)**
- At maturity, refinance with same or different lender
- LTV may improve if asset appreciates or track record established

- Proceeds go first to lender (repay principal + interest)
- Excess to SPV / equity holders

**3. Extension (If Lender Agrees)**
- Pay extension fee, provide updated appraisal
- Extend for additional 12 months

**4. Default (Worst Case)**

- Commercially reasonable sale required
- Borrower walks away (non-recourse)

---

## IX. NEGOTIATION POINTS

### **Borrower-Favorable Terms to Request**

1. **No Personal Guarantee:** Keep loan non-recourse to SPV members
2. **Lower Origination Fee:** Negotiate to 1.5-2.0% vs. 3.0%
3. **No Covenant on Distributions:** Allow SPV to distribute excess cash (if any) to equity holders
4. **Right to Substitute Collateral:** If additional assets acquired, ability to swap collateral (rare but worth asking)
5. **Interest Rate Cap:** If floating rate, negotiate cap at 12.0% or lower

---

### **Lender-Favorable Terms to Expect**

1. **Cross-Default Provisions:** If SPV or parent defaults on other obligations, triggers this loan
2. **Material Adverse Change Clause:** Lender can demand repayment if asset value drops >20%
3. **Additional Collateral Requirement:** If LTV breaches threshold, borrower must post additional collateral or pay down loan
4. **Prohibition on SPV Dissolution:** SPV cannot voluntarily dissolve while loan outstanding
5. **Audit Rights:** Lender can inspect books and records at any time

---

## X. ALTERNATIVES TO TRADITIONAL CREDIT FACILITY

### **Option A: Tokenized Debt (On Stellar)**

Instead of traditional loan, issue debt tokens on Stellar:

**Structure:**
- Issue `ALEX42M-DEBT` tokens on Stellar
- Each token = $1 of debt principal
- Distribute to lenders (multiple lenders possible)
- Pay interest quarterly via Stellar payments (in USDC or XLM)

**Advantages:**
- Fractional lending (multiple lenders can participate)
- Transparent (all payments on-chain)
- Lower documentation cost (smart terms, less legal)

**Disadvantages:**
- Still requires securities compliance
- Less familiar to traditional lenders
- May be harder to enforce in court

---

### **Option B: Revenue Participation Agreement**

Instead of fixed interest, lender receives % of asset sale proceeds:

**Structure:**
- Lender provides $10M
- In return, receives 35% of asset sale proceeds (example)
- If asset sells for $50M, lender receives $17.5M (75% return)
- If asset sells for $30M, lender receives $10.5M (5% return)

**Advantages:**
- Aligns interests (lender wants high sale price)
- No fixed interest burden on borrower

**Disadvantages:**
- More equity-like (may still be treated as security)
- Complex to structure

---

## XI. RECOMMENDED APPROACH

**Target Lender:** Private credit fund or family office

**Rationale:**
- Balanced risk/reward
