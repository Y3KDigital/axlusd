Hi [Name],

We are seeking an initial **$5M–$10M** tranche under a secured credit facility backed by a **2kg rough chrysoberyl (alexandrite)** parcel appraised at **$42,000,000** (Aug 18, 2025).

The collateral is structured for institutional diligence:
- **Bankruptcy-remote SPV** issuer/borrower (formation in progress / formed)
- **Institutional vault custody** with vault receipt and all-risk specie insurance (in finalization)
- **Cryptographic verification**: the appraisal PDF fingerprint is locked via SHA-256 and designed to be anchored on XRPL for immutable auditability
- **Permissioned claim instrument** (`ALXUSD`) on XRPL for operational tracking/settlement (no smart contracts, no DeFi, no retail distribution)

We can share the full diligence packet under NDA, including:
- appraisal hash record + IPFS record
- custody/insurance requirements and deliverables
- legal IOU terms + redemption policy
- credit facility term sheet + LTV model
- on-ledger memo schema and issuance controls

If this matches your mandate, can we schedule a 30-minute call this week to confirm advance rate, tenor, and closing path?

Best,

**Notes for sender:**
- If custody is already live, replace “in finalization” with custodian name + receipt ID + insurer name.
- Do not use the word “stablecoin.”
- Keep distribution strictly institutional/permissioned.
