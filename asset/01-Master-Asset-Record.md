---

### Valuation Disclosures & Limitations

⚠️ **CRITICAL DISCLAIMERS:**

1. **Not a Guaranteed Liquidation Value**  
   The $42M appraisal represents estimated potential value based on cutting yield assumptions and current market conditions. Actual realized value may differ materially.

2. **Illiquid Asset Class**  
   Rough gemstones at this value level do not have quoted market prices. Sale requires negotiation with specialized buyers.

3. **Cutting Yield Uncertainty**  
   30% yield is an estimate based on appraiser experience. Actual yield will be determined only upon cutting.

4. **Market Price Volatility**  
   Average price of $14,000/ct for finished alexandrite is subject to market fluctuations based on:
   - Quality of finished stones
   - Size distribution
   - Global luxury goods demand
   - Geopolitical factors

5. **Conservative Use for Financing**  
   For credit or tokenization purposes, haircuts of 40-80% (implying LTV of 20-60%) are typical for illiquid gemstone assets.

---

### Revaluation Schedule
**Next Appraisal Update Due:** August 18, 2026

**Full Re-Appraisal:** Every 3 years or upon request of lender/investor
